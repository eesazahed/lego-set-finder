# lego-set-finder
Finds lego sets with rebrickable.com.

You can type in the theme and name of the set you want to see. For the API key, I signed up and generated a free API key, which gives access to an object of Lego sets.
I made this site just for fun, and because Legos used to be my favourite childhood toy.
